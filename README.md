## AngularJS - A Lightning Talk and Simple Example

This repository was originally designed in preparation for a lightning talk for <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/"> Dev Bootcamp </a> students in September 2014. 

## Topics for Discussion 

* Why to invest your time in Angular
	* Comparison v. JavaScript & jQuery
	* Google support and growing community momentum
  * Growing documentation and support base
* Basic directives 
* Data-binding (one-way and two-way)
  * [The model as the single source of truth](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding)
* Filters (e.g. simple search)
* Services
* Client-side validations
* AJAX calls

In the static pages and Rails examples in this repo, I've tried to build [breakable toys](http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) that demonstrate simple examples of all of the above. Ideally, I would love for DBC students and others to improve upon and add examples to this repo, so feel free to submit pull requests from your fork.
