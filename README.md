## AngularJS - A Lightning Talk and Simple Examples

This repository was originally designed in preparation for a lightning talk for <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/"> Dev Bootcamp </a> students in September 2014. The repo structure is as follows:

<i> Static Pages Example </i>

Based largely on a DBC Phase 0 Exercise where students create a movie-star talent agency, this folder attempts to show some basic use cases for Angular (filters, data-binding, etc.). Because there is no associated web server, this example cannot demonstrate AJAX calls, Protractor, etc. However, I think it's a good starting point and easier to get up and running than starting off in Rails.

<i> Rails Example </i>

This folder attempts to show how to build a one-page app in Rails as a personalized homepage with an Angular front-end. I use the following Angular related gems: [angularjs-rails](https://github.com/hiravgandhi/angularjs-rails), [angular-rails-templates](https://github.com/pitr/angular-rails-templates) and [protractor-rails](https://github.com/tyronewilson/protractor-rails).

## Topics for Discussion 

* Why to invest your time in Angular
	* Comparison v. JavaScript & jQuery
	* Google support and growing community momentum
  * Growing documentation and support base
* Basic directives 
* Data-binding (one-way and two-way)
  * [The model as the single source of truth](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding)
* Services (registered and creating your own)
  * Dependency injection and injecting services into controllers
* Filters (e.g. simple search)
* Client-side validations
* AJAX calls

In the static pages and Rails examples in this repo, I've tried to build [breakable toys](http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) that demonstrate simple examples of all of the above. Ideally, I would love for DBC students and others to improve upon and add examples to this repo, so feel free to submit pull requests from your fork.
